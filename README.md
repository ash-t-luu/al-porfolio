## Overview 

Welcome to my portfolio website, created with the goal of learning Next.js. 

## Features
üé® **Tailwind Integration**: Used Tailwind to develop light and dark mode, hover/static styling, animations, and responsive design. This was a fun experience using Tailwind's integration features of variants, ease of modifying tailwind.config.css, functionality, and screen-scaling capabilities.
  
üèÉüí® **SSR and React Server Components**: Using the latest App Router, I was mindful of determining which components should stay as Client or Server components for rendering performance. It was a nice learning experience to using server actions, determining best folder practices, and the integration of Next.js routes and pages. Not only was I exposed to Next.js 13 App Router, but I familiarized myself with Next.js Page Router and the older way of data fetching and folder/file management.
  
‚å®Ô∏è **Windows Environment**: It was a challenging, yet rewarding experience using Windows with Powershell, Ubuntu for WSL, and bash terminal in my VSCode environment.
